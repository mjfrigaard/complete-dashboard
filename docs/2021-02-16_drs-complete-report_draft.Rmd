# OVERALL DESCRIPTION

*This section describes the general factors that affect the dashboard/app and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides an overview of those requirements, which are defined in detail in the 'REQUIREMENTS' section, and makes them easier to understand.*

The [complete-report] dashboard is displays the information contained in the `Fields_DataCompleteness_270302_YYYYMMDD` excel files, which are distributed via outlook to identified audiences. 

### Dashboard/app perspective

The figure below gives an overview of the high level data flow between the [complete-report] dashboard and other files and components:

```{r bmrn-complete-report-flow-png, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.height = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/bmrn-complete-report-flow.png")
```

### Dashboard/app functions  

The [complete-report] dashboard will provide a tabular summary of the completed study measurements by dataset, field, and corresponding SAS label.

### User characteristics  

The [complete-report] dashboard will be made available on the [shiny server]. The target audience is:

- CDM (entire group?)
- Data Managers 
- [audience?]
- [audience?]

### Constraints

The dashboard frontend shall be implemented using:

- SAS (calculations and summary report generation)  
- Excel (output file from SAS)  
- R (Excel file manipulation and shiny display)  

### Assumptions and dependencies

# DASHBOARD/APP REQUIREMENTS

This section covers the specific requirements and design of the [complete-report] dashboard. 

## Dashboard/app overview

### Mockup UI 

The initial landing page (Fields Listing) is below. 

```{r bmrn-complete-report-fields.png, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.height = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/bmrn-complete-report-fields.png")
```

The Removed Listing page is below:

```{r bmrn-complete-report-removed.png, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '100%', out.height = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/bmrn-complete-report-removed.png")
```


### Mockup Server 

### Use case overview

Below is an example note for the **Fields listing**:

```MD
**CMF** has 200 missing values. 

`SAS Label` is `Bleed Visit Number`
```



Below is an example note for the **Removed listing**:

```MD
`DSTERMOT` has been removed. 

The `SASLabel` is `Other screen fail reason`
```
